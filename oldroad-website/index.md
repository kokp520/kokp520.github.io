## Introduction {#introduction}

This project was completed before i enter the software industry.<br>

At that time, I created a website as a **side bussiness venture** for selling like `old school clothes`, cause many of my friends in the unversity dance club are enthusiasts of vintage culture.<br><br>

However, it is no longer in use at the moment.<br>
Because A free acount of **AWS EC2** and **RDS** is limited to a one year. LOL...

## Demo {#demo}

## Learning

### Node.js, Express, and MongoDB

 First of all, This project was not just about building a website, it was a testament to the potency of my acquired skills and the limitless potential of continuous learning.<br><br>

As I dived into the intricacies of `Node.js`, I was captivated by its event-driven architecture. `Express`, serving as the backbone, `streamlined the development process` and allowed me to focus on crafting remarkable features. <br>`MongoDB`, a NoSQL database, brought agility to data management, enabling seamless interactions between the application and the ever-expanding inventory.<br><br>

### Brain storming - process

The `process` was a fusion of self-guided learning and hands-on experience. I started to think what `users require` and how the bussiness models of those major brands were constructed. what kind of services are important to establish on the website.<br><br>

### Retrospect 

In retrospect, this achievement has force my foundation as a developer. My E-commerce creation not only showcases products but also `embodies the culmination of hours spent learning`.
